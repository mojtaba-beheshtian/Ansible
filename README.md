About Ansible:
Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

Ansible’s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It also has a strong focus on security and reliability, featuring a minimum of moving parts, usage of OpenSSH for transport (with other transports and pull modes as alternatives), and a language that is designed around auditability by humans–even those not familiar with the program.

Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner. There is never a question of how to upgrade remote daemons or the problem of not being able to manage systems because daemons are uninstalled. Also, security exposure is greatly reduced because Ansible uses OpenSSH — the open source connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.

Ansible is decentralized–it relies on your existing OS credentials to control access to remote machines. And if needed, Ansible can easily connect with Kerberos, LDAP, and other centralized authentication management systems.
