Building an inventory
-----------------------
Inventories organize managed nodes in centralized files that provide Ansible with system information and network locations. Using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command. Inventories also help you use Ansible more efficiently by reducing the number of command-line options you need to specify. For example, inventories usually contain the SSH user so you do not need to include the -u flag when running Ansible commands.

In the previous section, you added managed nodes directly to the /etc/ansible/hosts file. Now letâ€™s create an inventory file that you can add to source control for flexibility, reuse, and for sharing with other users.

Note:
Inventory files can be in INI or YAML format. For demonstration purposes this section uses YAML format only.

Complete the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window on your control node.

2. Create a new inventory file named inventory.yaml in any directory and open it for editing.

3. Add a new group for your hosts then specify the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of each managed node with the ansible_host field. The following example adds the IP addresses of three virtual machines in KVM:

    virtualmachines:
      hosts:
        vm01:
          ansible_host: 192.0.2.50
        vm02:
          ansible_host: 192.0.2.51
        vm03:
          ansible_host: 192.0.2.52

4. Verify your inventory. If you created your inventory in a directory other than your home directory, specify the full path with the -i option.

	ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --list

5. Ping the managed nodes in your inventory. In this example, the group name is virtualmachines which you can specify with the ansible command instead of all.

	ansible virtualmachines -m ping -i inventory.yaml

ansible virtualmachines -m ping -i inventory.yaml

vm03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vm02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
vm01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Congratulations! You have successfully built an inventory.
